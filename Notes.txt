# Open AI API

# For these scripts to work, you need an Open AI API key. 
# You can get one here:
# https://platform.openai.com/signup

# You need to put this key into an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY

# I am also providing you with a key that you can use for this project, but
# getting your own key is a good idea if you want to do more experiments on your own

# You also need to install the openai python package. 

# The whole process is described here:
# https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python
